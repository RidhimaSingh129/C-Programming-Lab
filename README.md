# C-Programming-Lab
"This repository contains solutions for the Lab Task-1 assignment in C programming. It includes programs for binary conversion, string manipulation, pattern printing, arithmetic operations using functions, and recursion. "  
The assignment focuses on fundamental programming concepts, including:
Converting numbers to binary using loops.
Counting vowels and consonants using pointers.
Arithmetic operations with functions in a menu-driven program.
Printing a diamond-shaped pattern using loops.
Finding the length of a string with pointers.
Calculating GCD using recursion.

Each program is thoroughly tested and written to enhance understanding of loops, functions, pointers, and recursion in C.
